TriesteinBus
============

This app is useful for finding waiting times for the bus stops in Trieste (Italy). It is currently in heavy development.

At the moment the only thing it can do is finding the arrival times by the bus stop id. Unfortunately, this is quite unconfortable because these are usually codes found by the bus stop (e.g. FER-D5020), but then the arrival times are displayed nicely.
